## About Me

  Hello, my name's Dakota, I am a programmer and gamer from Holbrook, PA.
  My nerd friends call me Kloddy.
  I consider myself to be a professional and laid back person.

### Past Ventures and Growing Interest In Computer Science

 I used to play a game called warcraft 3 when I was in middle school. This later
 grew to an interest in learning how video games were made. I first explored the game's
 "World Editor" which allowed anyone to create a custom minigame, or "map", within warcraft 3.
 When I was 15 years old I ended up joining a forum called The Hive Workshop.
 It is a site that passionate players create custom maps, spells, and other graphical details for warcraft 3.
 I learned a lot about programming by tinkering with the World Editor that was provided with the game.
 I made two submissions on the site, one involving a pack of spells to be used in a custom map, and the other spell is a recreation of an ability from World of Warcraft. The forums are very picky about the types of submissions that moderator's approve but I ended up having both my submissions approved by a moderator. You can view them here: [Link](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/disarm-v1-0.155163/) and here: [Link](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/death-grip-v1-02-final.155610/)
 This further blossomed into a healthy interest in computer science which lead me to get my Associates degree in Computer Information Systems.

# Current Employment
    Currently I work for a company Called Sherwin-Williams employed as a Third Key Sales Associate.
   Without any prior knowledge of the paint world or customer service I took the job thinking it would be a great opportunity to learn from a very reputable company. I have met a lot of interesting people. Although I do enjoy the job and I have learned a lot from it I am excited to open a new chapter in my life and explore the software development universe.
