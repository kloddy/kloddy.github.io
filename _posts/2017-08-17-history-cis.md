title: Past Ventures and Growing Interest in Computer Science
---
I used to play a game called Warcraft 3 when I was in middle school. This later
grew to an interest in learning how video games were made. I first explored the game's
"World Editor" which allowed anyone to create a custom mini-game, or "map", within Warcraft 3.
When I was 15 years old I ended up joining a forum called The Hive Workshop.
It is a site that passionate players use to upload created custom maps, spells,
and other custom graphical details for Warcraft 3.
I learned a lot about programming basics by tinkering with the World Editor that was provided with the game.
I made two submissions on the site; one involved a pack of spells to be used in a custom map, and the other was a re-creation of an ability from World of Warcraft. The forum moderators are very picky about the types of submissions they approve, but both of mine were approved. You can view them by clicking [here](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/disarm-v1-0.155163/) or [here](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/death-grip-v1-02-final.155610/).
This further blossomed into a healthy interest in computer science which lead me to get my Associates degree in Computer Information Systems.
